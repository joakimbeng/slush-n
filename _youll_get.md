## What you'll get

* A configured `.travis.yml` file for [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/) builds
* An [`.editorconfig`](http://editorconfig.org/) and [XO](https://github.com/sindresorhus/xo) for consistent code style
* [AVA](https://ava.li) for awesome testing

You'll also get a simple folder structure:

```
├── src/    # Put module code here
└── test/   # Put test code here
```

### No gulp?

Yes, that's right! I favor using npm scripts instead. It has saved me many hours in comparison to gulp and grunt. See [How to Use npm as a Build Tool](http://blog.keithcirkel.co.uk/how-to-use-npm-as-a-build-tool/) for a good intro to npm scripts.
